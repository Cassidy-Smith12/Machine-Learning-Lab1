 Exercise 1:
 Download the wine dataset from the following Machine Learning repository: ML Repository. 
 Rename wine.data to wine.data.csv. In wine.names, you can read the descriptions of all theattributes.
 The dataset contains 13 features (columns 2-14) that contribute to the quality of wine. The
 dataset contains data for three types, i.e., labels, of wines, identified by the category values: 1,
 2, and 3 (column 1). The dataset contains 178 records. Perform classification using KNN and,
 compute the accuracy of your model, print the confusion matrix, and predict to which one of
 the three classes the following four wines belong to given the following feature values:
 [14.23,1.71,2.43,15.6,127,2.8,3.06,.28,2.29,5.64,1.04,3.92,1065],
 [12.64,1.36,2.02,16.8,100,2.02,1.41,.53,.62,5.75,.98,1.59,450],
 [12.53,5.51,2.64,25,96,1.79,.6,.63,1.1,5,.82,1.69,515],
 [13.49,3.59,2.19,19.5,88,1.62,.48,.58,.88,5.7,.81,1.82,580]

 Exercise 2:
 Given the iris.data.csv, produce the following two scatter plots.
